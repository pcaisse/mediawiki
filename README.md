mediawiki
=========

MediaWiki API wrapper written in PHP. This wrapper was originally written for CiteClub (https://github.com/streetlight/citeclub).

Currently, the functionality implemented is limited to: login, logout, and edit.

There is an optional configuration file which can be used to set the cURL settings used to talk to the MediaWiki API. The URL of the MediaWiki is the only required setting.

For more on the MediaWiki API, see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API.
